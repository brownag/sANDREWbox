don't have much time to work on this, but wanted to make sure I was interpreting my memories correctly
I edited the man page for that function with some better visuals
here is one
plotSoilRelationGraph(res$adjMat, spanning.tree='max', 
edge.scaling.factor=0.1, vertex.scaling.factor=1, 
vertex.label.family='sans',
vertex.label.cex=0.75,
g.layout = layout_with_lgl) 

[?1/?9/?2018 3:53 PM] Beaudette, Dylan - NRCS, Sonora, CA: 
me too. I like the max spanning tree representation (need to write this up...) of complex networks generated by adjacency information. Essentially, it is the inverse of the min spanning tree... which makes more sense when edge weight is "distance" or "cost". in our case, "weight" is "evidence" so the max edge weight has meaningful interpretative value.
more ideas here

thanks for the fun diversion
BTW: there must be a nice way to compare the adj. matrix generated by spatial data vs. the component.adj.matrix approach

[?1/?9/?2018 3:55 PM] Beaudette, Dylan - NRCS, Sonora, CA: 
something for your TODO list
the max spanning tree representation of spatial data (this) and latest component data (from the URL I just sent & NASIS query) on two halves of an 11x17 page
now that would be nice

[?1/?9/?2018 4:04 PM] Brown, Andrew.G - NRCS, Sonora, CA: 
very cool idea. i'll take a crack at it

[?1/?9/?2018 4:05 PM] Beaudette, Dylan - NRCS, Sonora, CA: 
hey thanks
let me know if you need anything from me. An MLRA-wide version (via some kind of slippy web-map interface) has been a long-term (low priority) goal for some time now

[?1/?9/?2018 4:06 PM] Beaudette, Dylan - NRCS, Sonora, CA: 
d3 seems like a good option, but the networks get very large 

[?1/?9/?2018 4:06 PM] Brown, Andrew.G - NRCS, Sonora, CA: 
ah yeah i've seen some neat things done with d3
but i would imagine it would get large dealing with MLRA wide

[?1/?9/?2018 4:08 PM] Brown, Andrew.G - NRCS, Sonora, CA: 
	MUSYM 	most.common.neighbors

here's the preliminary answer to my question.

[?1/?9/?2018 4:09 PM] Beaudette, Dylan - NRCS, Sonora, CA: 
pretty
please keep track of that code somewhere, we will certainly come back to it!!
was that any more helpful than the alternative?

[?1/?9/?2018 4:10 PM] Brown, Andrew.G - NRCS, Sonora, CA: 
definitely will do. these sorts of things get a folder and a descriptive name in the sandbox
the alternative?
this just uses the adjacency matrix as is and chooses three highest weighted musyms for each urban unit

[?1/?9/?2018 4:12 PM] Beaudette, Dylan - NRCS, Sonora, CA: 
alternative = counting polygons
in ArcMap
[?1/?9/?2018 4:12 PM] Brown, Andrew.G - NRCS, Sonora, CA: 
aha
I thought thats what you might mean
yeah, i think its more informative
and easier
and it makes good sense to boot
[?1/?9/?2018 4:13 PM] Beaudette, Dylan - NRCS, Sonora, CA: 
glad you found a use for this thing, 3yrs post
[?1/?9/?2018 4:13 PM] Brown, Andrew.G - NRCS, Sonora, CA: 
but i'll be interested to delve a bit furhter into the weighting
yep, thanks for laying the groundwork as always
[?1/?9/?2018 4:14 PM] Beaudette, Dylan - NRCS, Sonora, CA: 
indeed. spdep / rgeos likely have the functions to do the heavy lifting
